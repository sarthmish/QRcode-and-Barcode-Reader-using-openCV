# QRcode-and-Barcode-Reader-using-openCV
This repository contains a real-time barcode and QR code detector implemented using Python and OpenCV. The project leverages machine learning concepts to enhance the accuracy and speed of barcode and QR code recognition, making it suitable for various applications such as payment systems, inventory management, and product tracking.

# Introduction
In today's environment, all goods and objects on the market are associated with a special identifier or ID, commonly known as a barcode. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that provides details about the object to which it is attached. Barcode detection has become increasingly popular and necessary as it simplifies various tasks, such as obtaining detailed information about a product quickly and efficiently.

QR codes are also widely used, particularly in payment systems like UPI. They are prevalent in shops, mobile applications, and advertisements, making our lives simpler. This project implements a real-time QR code reader using OpenCV, Python, and machine learning. The reader can scan QR codes in any condition.

Additionally, an authenticator feature is included, which stores authenticated barcodes and QR codes. It recognizes unauthorized codes, making it useful for various security applications.

# Features
Real-Time Detection: Detect barcodes and QR codes in real-time using live video feed.
Versatility: Recognize various forms of barcodes and QR codes under different conditions.
Machine Learning Integration: Continuously improve the model using live data for better accuracy and speed.
Authentication: Store and recognize authenticated barcodes and QR codes to identify unauthorized ones.
